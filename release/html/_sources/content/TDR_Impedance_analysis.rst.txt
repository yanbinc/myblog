#. **Which Python version should I use? 2.x or 3.x? 32bit or 64bit?**

    I suggest to use 2.7.x 32bit, because 3.x is not back compliance
    with 2.x. Many third-part libaray only support 2.x. 32bit is also 
    recommended, becasue 32-bit program could also work on 64bit OS.

#. **Which Python distribution should I use?**

    I suggest to use pythonxy(https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/), 
    which is a all in one package, including pyvisa, pyserial, wxpython, 
    numpy, scipy, matplotlib etc. Just one click installation, 
    I recommended full installation. Alterative way is install them one
    by one separately. 

    python(x,y) is a free scientific and engineering development software 
    for numerical computations, data analysis and data visualization 
    based on Python programming language.

#. **Which third-party libaray is necessary to install?**

    At least these packages are required: 

    - Pyvisa: python wrapper of visa32.dll, it is convinient for send 
      SCPI command to remote control instrument. It support 
      GPIB/USB/Serial etc.
    - Pyserial: it is for Serial port commnuication to control non visa 
      instrument like Iport, Temperature controller.
    - wxPython: GUI toolkit.

    These packages are optional:

    - Numpy/Scipy:can replace Matlab
    - Matplotlib: can replace Matlab plot
    - Others: xlrd/xlrd for Microsoft Excel read/write, 
      PIL for image processing

4. **Where could I find the documents ?**

    Search on google for offical document or find it locally
    C:\\Program Files (x86)\\pythonxy\\doc if pythonxy have installed.

5. **Why choose wxPython as GUI toolkit? How about PyQT?**

    PyQT is also good, but it is not free for comericial use, 
    wxPython is OK. Python standard library have tcl/tk GUI but it is 
    not powerful.

6. **Compared to Labview, do I need change hardware?**

    No, same hardware, only difference is software.

7. **Can I pack my python code into exe files?**

    Yes, use py2exe libaray. Plus, you can use Innostep pack it 
    into windows installer.

8. **Any IDE for Python?**

    Python source code is pure text, any editor could be used. VIM, 
    Emacs, notepad++, etc.

9. **Any coding style for Python**

    PEP 0008(http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Style Guide 
    for Python Code. One of import item is use 4 spaces per 
    indentation level.
