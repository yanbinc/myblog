Install Python and Packages
==========================

Too many choice are existing for Python distribution.
Python have 2.x and 3.x version, which are not fully compatible.
Python also have 32bit and 64 bit, 32bit Python could run both 32bit and 
64bit OS.

I suggest to use 3.x 64bit, because python 2.7 will reach the end of its life on Jan 1st,
2020.Python 2.7 won't be maintained after that date. 

I suggest to install python through Visual Studio which can help you compile your code without
extra installation in future.


Install python
----------------

The Visual Studio package could be download from:

    https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/


The following is a example of install python(64bit) on Windows7 64bit system.

1. Double click the installer

2. Select **Full** installation

3. click next to continue

4. click next to continue

5. click Finish to complete the installation steps

Don't hesitate to try Python right away. Many existing ways
to start a python interpreter. A interpreter is for interactive
between user and computer, as Python is dynamic scripting language
which do not need any compile process.


1. Open a dos command console, and type "python"
2. Open IDLE, which is a build-in simple python IDE
3. Use `ipython <http://ipython.org/>`_ , which is a powerful 
   interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based, type "ipython" to start

Ipython will be used to demo code in this tutorial, I prefer to use ipython
than other interpreters because it has many handy features.

As many other tutorials, we start with a "Hello world" example.
The code will use print function to print the string to console.

Install Packages
--------------
1. pip install
    pip install some-package 
    pip install some-package --proxy='http://proxyserver:port'
2. install from local archives
    pip install c:\some-dir\Some-file.tar.gz
    pip install c:\some-dir\Some-file.whl
3. install for different python version.
    py -2 -m pip install some-package
    py -3 -m pip install some-package
